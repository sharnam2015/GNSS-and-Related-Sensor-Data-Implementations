# This Repository is related to GNSS and GNSS related sensor data analysis , noise characterization. 
The NMEAparsing file shows how raw GNSS data from NMEA strings can be analyzed, converted to multiple different reference frames and plotted with basic outlier rejection. 
The sigmaUREcharacterization file shows how a sigma User Range Error Value can be characterized for a static measurement case. Three different methods have been used and compared.
